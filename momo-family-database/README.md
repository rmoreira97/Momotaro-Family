I want to make the momotaro-family website to be similar to the 3d web, 
however there are a few key differences in how i want to create it: 

1. It will be similar in that all the elements, or web pages, will be floating text in a 3d area , upon scroll, or clicking of one of the gorillas, you can be transported through the 3d space to where the section is located. 

2. the order of floating elements will be as follows: 

upon entry: 

gorilla family outline png located in assets folder is the  landing page, the png will be floating and can be spun 360 degrees upon clicking and dragging using threejs  

below that, a floating "enter" sign  - upon click, the user is taken to : 

2. selection page - 

the selection page is located a bit behind the landing - on the z-axis, meaning it is slightly visible from the enter page.     when enter is clicked,  the user is "zoomed" to that z axis where the selection page is located within the 3d plane. 

in the selection page, there will be 4 floating heads, all  relevant to their respective ID's in the api, 

this means, that after the selection page, there will be four profiles : 1. Momotaro 2.Genki. 3. Gentaro. 4.Kintaro 

all of these will be floating like the other elements, and once a gorila head is clicked, the user is zoomed along the z axis to this  element. upon entering one of the profiles, the user can scroll down to see the rest of the profile, or click on an arrow to go to the next profile, or click back to go to the selection page
